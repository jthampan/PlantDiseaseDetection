# Comprehensive Testing Feature - Usage Guide

## 🎯 Overview
The enhanced prediction script now includes comprehensive testing capabilities that automatically evaluate your model on all test images and generate detailed visualization plots.

## 🚀 Features Added

### 1. Automated Batch Testing
- Tests model on all images in `data/plant_diseases/test/` directory
- Processes images from all available disease classes
- Handles large datasets efficiently (limits to 50 images per class for speed)
- Provides real-time progress updates

### 2. Comprehensive Accuracy Analysis
- **Overall Accuracy**: Total correct vs wrong predictions
- **Per-Class Accuracy**: Individual performance for each disease type
- **Confidence Analysis**: Distribution of prediction confidence scores
- **Confusion Analysis**: Most commonly confused disease pairs

### 3. Automated Visualization Generation
All plots are automatically saved to `outputs/plots/` directory:

#### 📊 accuracy_summary.png
- Pie chart and bar chart showing overall accuracy
- Clear visualization of correct vs wrong predictions

#### 🔥 confusion_matrix.png
- Detailed confusion matrix (38x38 for all disease classes)
- Heatmap visualization showing prediction patterns
- Helps identify which diseases are most confused

#### 📈 per_class_accuracy.png
- Bar chart showing accuracy for each individual disease
- Color-coded: Green (>80%), Orange (60-80%), Red (<60%)
- Shows number of test images for each class

#### 📊 confidence_distribution.png
- Histogram comparing confidence scores for correct vs wrong predictions
- Shows mean confidence lines for both categories
- Helps understand model certainty patterns

#### 🖼️ correct_predictions_samples.png
- Grid of 6 sample images that were predicted correctly
- Shows true disease name and confidence score
- Demonstrates successful model performance

#### 🖼️ wrong_predictions_samples.png
- Grid of 6 sample images that were predicted incorrectly
- Shows true disease, predicted disease, and confidence
- Helps identify problem areas

#### 🔄 confusion_analysis.png
- Horizontal bar chart of top 10 most confused class pairs
- Shows which diseases are most commonly mistaken for each other
- Valuable for understanding model limitations
